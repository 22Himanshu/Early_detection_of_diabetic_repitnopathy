# Early_detection_of_diabetic_repitnopathy
Check blindness level based on fundus photos
The description of problem is as follows-  
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to automatically detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. By leveraging a large dataset of images, the goal is to enable early diagnosis of this leading cause of blindness, particularly in underserved areas. The automated screening process aims to improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely interventions, thereby preventing vision loss. This model can also be adapted for the detection of other eye diseases, enhancing overall eye health management.
